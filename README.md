# Student Performance Prediction 

**Minor Project (21CSA391A)**
**Student Name:** Mohammed Khan
**Roll No:** AA.SC.U3BCA2307072

##  Project Overview
This project applies a **Linear Regression** model to predict the final academic grades (G3) of students based on demographic and social data. The dataset used is the *Student Performance Data Set* from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##  Files Included
* **Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb:** The Jupyter Notebook containing all python code, data preprocessing, and model training.
* **Project_Report.pdf:** The complete academic report detailing objectives, methodology, and results.
* **student-mat.csv:** The dataset used for training the model.

##  Key Results
* **Model Accuracy (R²):** ~72%
* **Key Insight:** Previous academic performance (G1 and G2 grades) is the strongest predictor of the final grade.

##  Tools Used
* Python
* Pandas & Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
